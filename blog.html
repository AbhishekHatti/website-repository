            The Navodaya Vidyalaya system is a unique experiment unparalleled 
            in the annals of school education in India and elsewhere. 
            Its significance lies in the selection of talented rural children as the target 
            group and the attempt to provide them with quality education comparable to the 
            best in a residential school system. Such children are found in all sections of society, 
            and in all areas including the most backward.
